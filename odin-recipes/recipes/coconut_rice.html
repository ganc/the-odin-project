    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>While coconut rice can be found across the Asian continent and throughout the Pacific, this recipe takes inspiration from a traditional Malaysian recipe called Nasi lemak.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups of water</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup Jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 tsp coconut oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients</li>
        <li>Place rice in a fine mesh strainer, and rinse with cold water, stirring rice using your fingers to remove excess starch, until water from rice runs clear, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Place rinsed rice, coconut milk, water, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan; stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture in saucepan to a boil over medium heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer, undisturbed, for 11 minutes. Turn off heat; steam, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Uncover and gently stir in coconut oil.
<li>Enjoy!</li>
